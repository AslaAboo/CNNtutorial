# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) tutorial

## Instructions

1. Bash the `kaggleAPI.sh` script. For this you can either use a terminal shell (Linux/Mac OS) or RStudio's. Learn more [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal).
2. Install all packages listed on top of the script. `EBImage` is deposited in BioConductor, all other packages in CRAN.
3. Run `script.R`.
